New implementation of HBT in C++ . This is the hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelized version. Check the [Hydro](https://github.com/Kambrian/HBT2/tree/Hydro) branch for a pure OpenMP version.

Documentation is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/Kambrian/HBT2/wiki).

This version adds support for Gadget-4 hdf snapshot and group format as used in the Jiutian Main simus. Currently only DM-only runs are supported.
